#  CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50

###  DL Project 4 â€” Image Classification with Transfer Learning

---

##  Overview

This project applies a **ResNet50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for object recognition on the 
**CIFAR-10** dataset. It leverages **transfer learning** to classify images into 10 categories, achieving high accuracy even with a relatively small dataset.

##  Dataset

**CIFAR-10** is a labeled subset of the [80 million tiny images dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), consisting of:

-  50,000 images (32x32 pixels, RGB)
  - 40,000 for training
  - 10,000 for testing
-  10 Classes:
  - Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck
